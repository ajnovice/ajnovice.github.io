                From time to time I come across a profound statement

                It was the right decision to put this under the heading <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19459918">Off Topic PostThought</a>.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Learning JavaScript is when what Dostoevsky,
                Kierkegaard, Sartre and Camus were all trying to
                communicate really hit home for me. Meanwhile a recent
                foray into Rust is reminding me of the first time I
                read books like Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, Borge's
                Labyrinths and Steinbeck's East of Eden.</p>

            <p>A discussion about the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16912546" rel="noopener noreferrer external">misery of finding a programming job</a> yielded two standout comments.</p>

            <p>
                The first is interesting for the floral dimension it
                adds to what would otherwise be a generic
                pat-yourself-on-the-back:
            </p>


            <blockquote>
                <p>I am like the flower of lotus - waiting. When there is anything interesting I can jump ships using [my recruiter] network to help with the interview. After my first job, I never had the need to search personally.</p>

            </blockquote>

            <p>The second adds conspiracy theory, which of course makes everything better:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>That probably shows HR is just "working" and doing interviews. Not necessarily to hire anyone…they might just be gathering data. Maybe harvesting the people available on the market. Checking if you are up to doing homework and not getting paid. Checking what your salary is. Telling you make some ranking challenges. Building a profile about you.</p>
                <p>Your profile might get a price-tag and shared on the HR black market. I suspect there are even black lists by segment shared on some HR black markets.</p>

                I type dip, and the paragraph is gone. d2ip would kill 2 paragraphs. This is almost instantaneous. I don't really type <code>dip</code> in sequence, though. It's not so deliberate. I kind of form my fingers in the right heights as they all fall simultaneously, striking in a kind of fraction-of-a-second arpeggio that sounds like a single key press. It's total muscle memory. It's just an action in my brain now that happens without thought. I also don't think so much in terms of discrete actions like <code>dip</code> anymore. I think in streams of small bursts of them. The muscle memory composes into new things. I know I want to move a block 2 down from where it is, but I don't start performing the actions of that. I do <code>dap2}p</code>, and it's done in about 0.5 seconds. I didn't think at all.

            <blockquote>
                Mechanical machines are really satisfying, for their tactileness and simplicity. I have a typewriter, watching real impressions appear on real paper is way more fulfilling, and the organicness of the interaction is not even nearly matched in any computer program I used: you're always detached from the circuitry, where with mechanical devices you're a part of it. But the advantages of computerised production far outweigh those of mechanical devices, so I only type on my typewriter every once in a while as a recreative activity.

          <blockquote>
            My experience with FreeBSD is limited to a fugacious week with apparent quixotism and my noble Raspberry-Pi2, which ended inimically. All seemed rigorously dandy until presumably, Chuck Norris imposed thereafter some wicked temporal augmentation between all moments between any character typed or program otherwise compiled, offering only a typographic respite or scintillating scroll of never-ending techno-glossolalia in his wake whilst I sat there hour after hour (or character after character) awaiting something that made sense. Having no visible recourse, I capitulated and returned to Rasbpian.

Apparently his idea worked, because in the next test my zinc was over the ideal (This <em>could</em> be a fluke, of course).”

            <p>This one about <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8920871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer external">the Netflix platform</a> is hilariously pompous.</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>
                    “Considering it’s all built on well-known and tested (provided you
                    follow the best practices) cloud services (AWS right?) I often wonder
                    what they do all day. Netflix platform strikes me as something you
                    invest heavily in at day 1 but then only need a boilerplate team of
                    developers to keep it ticking over and responding to user feedback.
                </p>

                <p>
                    They love to bleat on about their Chaos Monkey this and Chaos Monkey
                    that. But come on, they wrote a read-only cloud-hosted and distributed
                    video streaming service that leans on standard cloud services and best
                    practices for 90% of the hard parts. Chaos Monkey just smacks of
                    writing an integration test for a third party component you don’t own.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Frankly I wouldn’t want a job at Netflix simply because the problem
                    domain is not interesting enough…”
